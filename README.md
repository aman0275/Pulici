# Pulici App

This project is designed to ease the work of police and the long waiting and questionnaire step for the common people. Our application is easy to use with user-friendly UI that has basic registration process and one step Information page that asks user to fill out the details regarding their type of complain.

Users can track the status of their complaints easily with just one click while police officers can change the status of the complaints that they are working on and can add some comments/progress which users can see in order to get updated on their complain progress.
